/**
 * Encapsulates the connections between a set of Neurons on the left (with bias)
 * and a set of Neurons on the right, of the same size as the left Neurons but
 * without the bias.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each Neuron on the right is connected to the corresponding Neuron on the left
 * and also to the left-hand bias unit, with weights applied to both
 * connections.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The weight for connection between the left hand bias with right hand Neuron i
 * is called a shift, and the weight for the connection between Neuron i on the
 * left and Neuron i on the right is called a scale.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Activation of RightNeuron(i) = scale(i) * Activation of LeftNeuron(i) +
 * shift(i)
 *
 * <p>
 * These Axons are parameterised by a scale vector and a shift vector, each of
 * length matching the number of Neurons on the right.
